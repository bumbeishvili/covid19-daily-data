# Worldometers daily data

#### Notes
Due to changes in methodology or lack of information, or just because of bugs, sometimes we need to apply modifications to past records, currently I am identifying the need of following changes

1. Recovered items in UK needs fixing, in Worldometer, sometimes they are showing NaN, we can show previous number instead
2. Missing of some small countries. Fortunatelly historical data is saved and we can work on that too
3. China numbers - on 17 April, China changed their reported numbers, we will need to spread it proportionally , or not, not sure. Anyway, putting a note about it here
4. One of the Congo's data is not updated, it will need manual data extraction from Worldometer
5. France, Spain, UK and Norwey problem
6. Turkey - sudden increase case
7. 6 Jan - Forgot to add data, so had to interpolate it

#### Notes for self when using historical data
* We manually updated data for France, so we should be careful not to overwrite it

## Foreword

Recently (from 23 March) [CSSEGISandData/COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) stopped supplementing recovered data for covid-19.  This was the final issue which motivated me to let this repo go and started my own data repository building.

Recovery information is very important, because we can calculate active cases based on it and  check progress of disease in the world.

Several days later,  they started recording recovered data again on world scale, but because of so many unreliable modifications, I think, I will be sticking to own data fetching. 




## How

Data will just come from Worldometers and it will be updated daily

## Automation
Beucase, I did not want to do this manually, I wrote a small js notebook, which scrapes worldometer page and merges that data with already existing data


https://observablehq.com/d/c99a630b3931dfbc

So we will just need to copy that merged data and paste to this csv file

## Lack of 
Some small countries may be lacking, I plan to identify and add them into dataset

## Data Recover Instructions
* Create new `YDay` branch from yesterday's commit
* Make it main branch
* Remove Master
* Create Master from Yday
* Make master main
* Visit - https://observablehq.com/d/532511bde07ffc9b - and add data as usual

## Data Recover Instructions - Current day - 3
Since worldometer does not show last 3 days data, it have to be interolated
* Visit - https://observablehq.com/d/cbef3b288d826b0f - and take a closer look at casesMerged,recoveredMerged,deathsmerged variables


## Contribution
They are welcome, but I doubt there will be need for this. One area which we can improve, is to standartize country names using ISO country codes
